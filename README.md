# React Native vs Traditional iOS Development

### Introduction
I recently learned how **React Native** has revolutionized app development for iOS! While **Swift** and **SwiftUI** are Apple's native programming languages/frameworks, **React Native** offers a compelling alternative. Here are the key differences:

### Traditional iOS Development
- **Uses**: Swift/SwiftUI  
- **Requirements**:
  - Requires a Mac  
  - Requires an Apple Developer account ($99/year)  
- **Platform**: Only works on iOS  

### React Native
- **Uses**: JavaScript/React  
- **Benefits**:
  - Works on both iOS and Android from the same code  
  - Can develop on any computer  
  - Much easier to learn if you know JavaScript  
- **Adoption**: Used by major apps like Instagram, Discord, and Walmart  rd, Walmart
